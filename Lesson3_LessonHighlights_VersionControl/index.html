            <p class="lead">A version control is a way for you to share files. It is one main repository for all the project files. It allows for different individuals to make changes and then share them. What keeps track of all the changes is a version control system. This keeps track of who, what, and when it was edited. This allows for many people to edit something and it is merged all into one file. The system also allows you to have access to previous versions that you created, so you do not lose your work. This allows for developers to see where they started to the new version that they created. </p>

            <p class="lead">A remote repository is a remote server that is shared among multiple people that connects different team members to the same information and the changes others make. It pushes and pulls the shared information between the different local repositories.  Basically remote repository are different versions of your project big or small that shared on the internet or various networks. You can many different remote repositories that can be used for different reasons for instances one could be used to just gather information where another one could be used for you to make changes on and used to gather other information. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a type of versions control system this means it allows you to share files between different systems. By sharing your work through a versions control system you can never overwrite work you have done since that information is stored and shared.  All information is stored locally, so you can store and edit it often. GIT runs on different commands. The three main commands are add, commit, and push. Add and commit are the process of summiting your work into a file and push is the command to share your work to store and have various ways to access. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Local repository is a repository that stays on a local machine of an individual user. The local repository is what communicates with the more expanded repository, the remote repository. There are two ways you can create a local repository. One being you create a brand new repository or two you can clone an additional existing remote repository onto your individual local machine. The local repository is what stores your files and then is shared to the remote repository to either send out the information you created or changed, or it is used to bring shared files for you to use. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT commands are basic instructions when uses a repository. You begin with the command INIT which initialize the repository and you add the command origin which adds a remote. This pulls the repository such as the one we are using which is called GitHub. Then you command add which adds all the files that you have changed since previous times. Then the command commit then adds the changes that you made to the project such as a submit button. Then the final step is the command push which then sends the new information file from a local repository to a remote repository.  </p>
